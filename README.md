# StarKnight

Small game made with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)!

## Gameplay

In this game, you control a spaceship and your objective is to destroy waves of enemy spaceships. The player can move the spaceship using the arrow keys and shoot projectiles at the enemies using the space bar. The game ends if the player's spaceship is destroyed or after defeating all the enemy waves.

## Assets

All sprites are made in pixel-art using [Asperite](https://www.aseprite.org/). Color are inspired by [Steam Lords](https://lospec.com/palette-list/steam-lords) created by Slynyrd!

All sound effects are made in-house and edited with [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).
